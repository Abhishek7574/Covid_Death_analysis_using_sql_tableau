2. **Data Splitting:** The data was split into two Excel files: one for COVID deaths and another for people vaccinated.

3. **SQL Database:** The data was uploaded into an SQL database for efficient querying.

4. **Querying:** SQL queries were performed to extract detailed information country-wise and continent-wise.

5. **Table Extraction:** The results of the queries were organized into six different tables.
